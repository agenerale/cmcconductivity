**Dataset description:**  
This is the repository for the Materials and Design paper titled "Reduced-order Models for Microstructure-Sensitive Effective Thermal Conductivity of Woven Ceramic Matrix Composites with Residual Porosity"

**Files Included:**
* ABAQUS input files for thermal analysis of all microstructures (3125)
* Statistical quantification of microstructures can be accomplished through the PyMKS github page: https://github.com/materialsinnovation/pymks. 
* The input principal component scores for all microstructures can be found in pcs.mat
